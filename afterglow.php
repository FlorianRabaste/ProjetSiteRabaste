            <p><b>Ran Mitake</b></p>
            <p>Age: 16</p>
            <p>Ran has short black hair with her short bangs partially tucked beneath her forelocks, one of which is dyed red. She has partially sharp dark red eyes. Her casual attire is fairly simple and monotone, befitting her rebellious and tomboyish personality. She wears a turtleneck light gray sweater, a black leather jacket, short ripped denim shorts, a black belt around her waist and a pair of black tights. In winter, she wears a red scarf with three pin-buttons on it, a blue sweater with the word "ROCK" spelled on it and two pin-buttons, a short black skirt with two decorative zippers and a pair of tights. In summer, she wears a transparent sleeveless shirt with a black tank top on top of it, ripped denim shorts, and a necklace. Prior to forming the band, Ran's hair was completely black and she didn't have her signature red stripe</p>

            <p><b>Tsugumi Hazawa</b></p>
            <p>Age:15</p>
            <p>Tsugumi views herself as the most normal girl in the band. However, she is a very hardworking and optimistic person who rarely gets discouraged, and her optimism buoys the other members' spirits. She is the one who also pushes the band to do and try different challenges, such as entering the Girls Jam concert event, and Tsugumi was even the one to suggest that the girls start a band. She can easily get flustered however, and tends to panic or have trouble with dealing with new people.</p>

            <p><b>Himari Uehara</b></p>
            <p>Age:16</p>
            <p>Himari is cheerful and good-natured and is the band coordinator. She struggles to read the mood of a situation, which means she sometimes does things that have no effect. She's weak to tear-jerkers and sentimental episodes and is fairly romantic. She is also weak to being teased and tends to be clumsy and fall around at times. She enjoys comparing the different sweets she buys from convenience stores and likes making them as well. She also likes cute things like clothing and stuffed animals but wants to be seen as "cool" by others. Her ideas are normally teased or rejected - but her bandmates try to show support in their own way.</p>

            <p><b>Tomoe Udagawa</b></p>
            <p>Age:16</p>
            <p>Tomoe is a fairly relaxed person, who never says anything bad about other people or holds grudges against them. She keeps the band from falling apart. She is idolized for her cool, but mature way of handling things. Despite her mature, punk look, she is very caring towards others and is always there to lend support or a shoulder to cry on. While she is unable to understand Ako's behavior at times, she loves her sister and supports her. She is also shown to be hot-blooded and the type to rush into things head-first if she thinks someone she loves has been hurt. This has a tendency to backfire on her at times. Adding to this, Tomoe is also capable of sharing the same mental wavelength as Kasumi and Kokoro.</p>
