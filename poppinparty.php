            <p><b>Kasumi Toyama</b></p>
            <p>Age:16</p>
            <p>Kasumi lives with her parents and has a younger sister, Asuka - whom she calls "Aa-chan" - however, it's not always clear who is the more responsible out of the two. When she was looking at the stars one night as a child, she heard a sparkling "Star Beat", and ever since that, she's been searching for it. She believes that she found it after she saw her guitar for the first time, and when she formed Poppin'Party.</p>

            <p><b>Tae Hanazono</b></p>
            <p>Age:15</p>
            <p>Tae lives with her parents and 20 rabbits. She has considerable skill with the guitar, since she started playing it when she was in elementary school. One day, when Tae had to finish her home economics assignment with Kasumi after school, she started interacting with her and taught her how to play the basic guitar chords. Tae at first doubted Kasumi's idea to audition at SPACE when she told her about it, because the band needed a considerable skill level to pass. But when Kasumi performed for the first time in front of their friends and family with Arisa, Rimi, and Tae herself, Tae realized how much fun she had performing with them, which led to her joining Kasumi's Poppin'Party as its fourth member. Adding to this, Tae was impressed by their own performance and believed in their potential.</p>

            <p><b>Rimi Ushigome</b></p>
            <p>Age:16</p>
            <p>Rimi's pink bass guitar is a hand-me-down from her older sister Yuri, who is two years older than her and also the lead vocalist of the band Glitter*Green. During Rimi's high school entrance ceremony, she heard Kasumi's self-introduction that was filled with boundless optimism, and this sparked her interest in her. Though Rimi wanted to change her cowardly and shy personality, she had initially been unable to do anything about it. At first, Rimi declined Kasumi's invitation to become a member of the band Poppin'Party because of her stage fright, but everything changed when she became inspired by Kasumi who sang on stage at Live House Space until Glitter*Green, who were late because of the weather, arrived. She eventually found her confidence to overcome her stage fright and managed to perform with Kasumi and Arisa. After the show, she finally decided to join Kasumi's band as its third member and bassist.</p>

            <p><b>Saaya Yamabuki</b></p>
            <p>Age:16</p>
            <p>Saaya is the oldest of three children in her family; she has a younger brother named Jun, and a younger sister named Sana. Saaya's family owns the Yamabuki Bakery, at which she helps out, even during the school term. Saaya used to play in a girls' band called CHiSPA when she was in middle school, but quit because she didn't want to burden her bandmates and her family due to an incident that happened before an important performance. But thanks to Kasumi, who never gave up on her, and her mother's support, she regained her passion for music and her desire to perform in a band, thus became the last member of Poppin'Party to join.</p>

            <p><b>Arisa Ichigaya</b></p>
            <P>Age:18</P>
            <p>Arisa's grandparents run a pawnshop called Ryuuseidou, and she lives in a big and traditional house, which includes a basement where Poppin'Party practices and hangs out at most of the time. Ryuuseidou is also the place where Kasumi found her guitar, Random Star, from. When she was younger, Arisa picked up to learn the piano but then quit it halfway because she didn't have any motivation to continue - when she befriended Kasumi and heard about her plans to start a band, she picked it up again.</p>
