            <p>Age:16</p>
            <p>An ordinary girl with no exceptional talents, Ayumu is seemingly content with just living a normal high school life. But when she and her best friend, Yu Takasaki, stumbled upon a school idol performance for the first time, a new path would suddenly appear in Ayumu's world. Despite not being able to sing or dance, Ayumu would nevertheless venture on to become a school idol herself.</p>

            <p>Age:16</p>
            <p>Kasumi had always dreamed of becoming an idol. Upon entering Nijigasaki, Kasumi would go on to join the School Idol Club as its most passionate member. But when the club fell into disarray, Kasumi's dreams never took off, and she would soon begin to doubt herself. Her sole presence in the club room would serve as a reminder that the School Idol Club has seen better days. Nevertheless, Kasumi still believes in the club and is determined to keep the dream alive. She would continue to strive to become a school idol and hopes to once again participate in club activities, especially with a senpai she adores. Along with Karin Asaka and Setsuna Yuki, she works with Dengeki Online.</p>

            <p>Along with Ayumu Uehara and Rina Tennoji, Ai works with Famitsu App. She has known her neighbor, since she was a child, and considers her to be her big sister. Because both of her parents work at her family's restaurant, she was mostly raised by her grandmother.</p>

                <p>Known as the group's "sleeping beauty," Kanata has the uncanny ability to somehow relax anybody in her presence. She formerly attended Shinonome Academy and has a little sister named Haruka. Along with Shizuku Osaka and Emma Verde, Kanata works with the Love Live! School idol festival app. Kanata attends Nijigasaki Academy on scholarship, so she studies really hard at night everyday, thus her sleep deprivation.</p>

                <p>Age:16</p>
                <p>When Setsuna saw school idols for the first time, it felt as if "fate" was calling out to her; the very reason for becoming a school idol herself. Seemingly always busy with school idol activities, Setsuna had become somewhat of an urban legend among the students at Nijigasaki, with many claiming they had never even seen her at school. Setsuna would always wear her idol outfit whenever she is with the Nijigasaki High School Idol Club. But the girl everyone knew as "Setsuna Yuki" had actually adopted that name herself, so that her parents would not figure out she was an idol. Setsuna had come from a strict household, where things like anime, manga, and school idols are banned. One reason why she became an urban legend is linked to the fact that she attends the same school as Nana Nakagawa, who has a different appearance than Setsuna. Along with Karin Asaka and Kasumi Nakasu, she works with Dengeki Online. The name "Setsuna Yuki" came from the characters of a light novel Nana read.</p>

                <p>Age:16</p>
                <p>Emma hails from Switzerland, and like the tranquil and majestic landscapes of the Swiss Alps, possesses a heart that is just as gentle and glowing. Coming from a family with eight younger siblings, she would leave her home country to pursue becoming a school idol in Japan, eventually transferring to Nijigasaki High School. She shares a dorm with Karin Asaka, whom she develops a close friendship with. She uses the Italian word "Buono" (meaning "good") when introducing herself, which indicates that she is from the Italian-speaking part of Switzerland, which includes the canton (Swiss Confederation member state) of Ticino and some southern parts of Grisons. Her family name "Verde" means "green" in Italian. Along with Shizuku Osaka and Kanata Konoe, Emma works with the Love Live! School idol festival app, where the three of them originally appeared as N-rarity characters. She formerly attended the Y.G. International Academy.</p>

                <p>Age:15</p>
                <p>Rina is not good at conveying emotions on her face. Because of this, she makes use of the "Rina-chan Board", a sketchbook that she draws her emotions on. Rina is also friends with Mia, who met her in Chapter 22 of ALL STARS. Despite her flaws, Rina is still trying to change herself by communicating and talking more with others. She admires Ai for her confidence and friendliness. Rina gets nervous easily but continues to try her best. As a school idol, she hopes that people will cheer for her so she can show everyone her true smile.</p>
