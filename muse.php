            <p>μ's (pronounced "Muse") was a school idol group formed and led by Honoka Kosaka in Love Live!. They were the school idol group of Otonokizaka High School. The group consisted of nine members and was initially formed with the purpose of bringing attention to the school as it was to be shut down due to a lack of future enrolling students. The group disbanded in the anime after the 3rd years graduated, staying true to their status as school idols, unlike their rival A-RISE, which choose to stay as an idol group even after school. In other words, μ's no longer exist as an idol group. However, they did make their final appearance in the movie. Their real life parallel of the voice actresses ended activities as a group on April 1, 2016 with the Final Live, ending their legacy. However, it was announced that the group would be returning with a new single, which was released on March 25t</p>

            <p><b>Nico Yazawa</b></p>
            <p>Age:17</p>
            <p>In Season 1 Episode 5, it is discovered that during her first year in high school she started an idol group. However, one by one the members gave up because Nico's goal to become an idol was too much for them and they couldn't keep up. In Season 2 Episode 4, it is revealed she has two younger sisters named Cocoro and Cocoa, and a younger brother Cotaro. Nico's father has been out of the picture, and so her mother is constantly out of the house in order to work and financially provide needs for her four children. Due to being in a single-parent household, money is tight and their living space is compact. Because Nico's mother is nearly never home, Nico has long since assumed the role of their household's head (or possibly sole) caretaker. Nico is the eldest by the largest age gap, with her three siblings being all much younger than her and closest to age with each other. Because of this, Nico is accustomed to and skilled in cooking and housekeeping. Most importantly, however, she seems to care very much for her younger siblings, and will do anything to make them smile. She will go as far as to lie in order to make them happy. This is discovered when Nico's siblings express their belief that the other members are Nico's backup dancers, which was a lie that Nico told them and substantiated with altered μ's posters in which she was the center (switched with Honoka). Unaware of the truth, Cocoro, Cocoa, and Cotaro act happy, proud, and inspired by the idea of their oldest sister's unparalleled success. All of this information comes as a surprise to the other members, as it runs contrary to her often self-centered behavior at school and during idol work. However, the revelation of Nico's home life provides insight as to why Nico's specific personality traits and values developed and how they inform her behavior within μ's. Her brazen desire for the spotlight and to be doted on is a product of not being afforded such attention due to her home situation. Nico's obsession with making others smile with her catchphrase ("Nico Nico Nii!" or にっこにっこにー) is related to when Nico would try her hardest to cheer up her family members during hardships.</p>

            <p><b>Maki Nishikino</b></p>
            <p>Age:15</p>
            <p>Maki comes from a highly reputable and wealthy family marked by doctors and hospital ownership. She is an only child, and thus, the sole heiress to her family's properties and legacy. Because of this, Maki is spoiled and doted on yet not given any long-term freedom to be anything other than a doctor. Maki respects her parents and does not question their expectations despite the immense pressure to live up to their standards and make them proud. Although Maki grew up singing and practicing piano, her parents' emphasis on Maki's medical concentration has made her accept that she ultimately must give up her passion for music, this becoming an increasing reality each year she grew older. She always had a notably beautiful voice, and she was able to compose her own piano pieces. Despite music always being her true passion, when Honoka invites her to join µ's, Maki refuses at first in accordance to her self-inflicted pressure to deny herself music in favor of her studies. Ultimately, she is able to admit and accept her true feelings of love for music and join µ's. Because of Maki's wealth, it is discovered in Season 1 Episode 10 that her parents own a beach house. Therefore, μ's gladly insisted that Maki should go and ask her parents if they could use it, which they allow. In Season 2 Episode 2, it is revealed that her family also owns a vacation house in the mountains.</p>

            <p>Age:16</p>
            <p>Honoka's family owns a Japanese sweets shop named Homura. She lives at the back of the shop with her mother, father, and her younger sister. Since she was young, she has been friends with Kotori Minami, and she befriended Umi Sonoda after inviting her to a game of hide-and-seek. She is also friends with Fumiko, Hideko and Mika at school. Her grandmother and her mother are both graduates from Otonokizaka.</p>

            <p><b>Eli Ayase</b></p>
            <p>Age:17</p>
            <p>Eli is partly Russian from her grandmother. Because of this, she is known to say the Russian word "хорошо" (pronounced as "Harasho"), which means "Good" or "Okay." Eli first says it in Season 1 Episode 10 when Umi Sonoda was awoken by the girls' pillow fight and she threw "supersonic pillows" in her rage. She has a younger sister named Alisa Ayase. She told Umi that her family has been living abroad since they were little and haven't really adapted to the lifestyle in Japan yet. Her grandmother is also an alumni of Otonokizaka High School, which furthered her urge to defend her school from getting shut down. In Season 1 Episode 7, it is shown that her mother and grandmother did ballet through the glimpse of the photos in her room, and it's a legacy passed down to Eli as she was also a ballet dancer herself when she was younger. However, later it is revealed that Eli was actually at the bottom of the list in ballet compared to the other dancers and could barely pass the auditions. Due to her constant failures, she gave up her dream of becoming a ballet dancer and gradually tried to close her heart and distance herself from her dream to shine and dance again.</p>

            <p><b>Nozomi Tojo</b></p>
            <P>Age:18</P>
            <p>Nozomi is a third year student and the former vice-president of the school's student council, being succeeded by Umi Sonoda. She is not originally from the Kansai region, and it is shown in Season 2 Episode 8 that she and her family had moved around for most of her childhood. However, she speaks in a relaxed Kansai dialect after having lived there for a few years during her childhood. She is fluent in a few other languages as well, including English. She is best friends with Eli. In the manga, Nozomi isn't in the student council; instead, she is the only member left in the Supernatural Phenomenon Research Society, a club that she attempted to recruit Eli into. In addition to this, she grew up in Akihabara and adopted her dialect to match her fondness for the supernatural. Since the first episode, Nozomi has shown her support for Honoka's group and their dream for being school idols, helping them find ways to work around Eli's orders so they can succeed on their dream, though she does help them directly as well. After Eli joins μ's on Season 1 Episode 8, she joins the group as well since she always wanted to do something with who she considers her friends. She is also the person behind the name of μ's; she decided it since it was the pronunciation for "Muses", which are what the nine Greek goddesses and daughters of Zeus are known as, and she knew the nine girls would eventually come together like them.</p>

                <P>Age:16</P>
                <p>Since she was young, Umi has been Honoka Kosaka and Kotori Minami's childhood friend, thanks to Honoka inviting her to a game of hide-and-seek. She is also a member of the school's archery club, at which she is quite good. She believes Honoka is bossy and pushy, but also realizes the perks of having an adventurous friend. Among the members of μ's, Umi takes the role of being their physical trainer. Umi has a far older sister who has already moved out.[2] Her father is a martial-arts trainer while her mother teaches traditional Japanese dance; as a result, Umi is expected to inherit the combined dojo of both. As the heiress to her lineage's legacy, she is burdened with the responsibility of carrying on her family's traditional Japanese practices and techniques. She also is highly skilled in kyūdō (弓道), or the Japanese martial art of archery. Predictably, Umi's traditional upbringing is reflected in her personality and behavior.</p>

                <p>Rin is a first year student who has been friends with Hanayo Koizumi since they were children. She is very well known for having a huge heart for cats and for acting like them; she tends to utter nya~! (meow), either as a way to end her sentences or to show her happiness. In addition, she sometimes acts like a cat and does the signature curved-mouth look. As a child, Rin was often teased for wearing skirts. Because of this, she decided to avoid wearing skirts and dresses in public, other than for her uniform. This insecurity is later what contributes to her inability to see herself as fit for a school idol, even though she really likes the idea of being one. Even so, she later joins μ's on Season 1 Episode 4 alongside Hanayo and her fellow classmate Maki, supporting the former in her endeavor to be a school idol.</p>
