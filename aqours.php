            <p><b>Hanamaru Kunikida</b></p>
            <p>Age:15</p>
            <p>Hanamaru, known as "Maru" for short (by herself and her friends) is a first year student and the daughter of a family who has run a nearby temple for generations. She lives with her grandparents, and since she does not have a computer, she often reads a lot. Hanamaru is Ruby Kurosawa's best friend, and both are often seen near the other. She also attended the same kindergarten as Yoshiko Tsushima, also one of her friends. Hanamaru has a distinctive verbal tic and dialect, tending to end her sentences with "zura" (ずら), as well as using "ora" as a first-person pronoun to refer to herself.She is a member of AZALEA, a sub-unit under Aqours.</p>

            <p>Age:15</p>
            <p>Yoshiko is a first year student who was born in the urban side of the city of Numazu. She attended the same kindergarten as her friend Hanamaru Kunikida, who she calls as "Zuramaru" (ずら丸). Her mother is a teacher at a school. Yoshiko likes the "little devil" look and proclaims herself to be "Yohane, the Fallen Angel" (堕だ天てん使しヨハネ Datenshi Yohane), an angel who has angered God and was cast from the heavens to Earth for it, developing a human body which is merely a vessel to which her soul is bound to. She has developed this persona since she was in kindergarten, and fully embraced it during middle school. Because of this, it is implied she didn't have many friends during that time. She is a member of Guilty Kiss, a sub-unit under Aqours.</p>

In the first episode, on a trip to Tokyo with Chika, the two learned about school idols and the Love Live! tournament after seeing a screen with school idols at the Akiba Dome, including µ's.

It is later revealed in Season 1 Episode 4 that she used to be a fan of school idols, sharing this hobby with her sister Ruby, although something caused her to lose that interest. This is explained in Season 1 Episode 6, Episode 8 and Episode 9, as she was part of a school idol group formed by Kanan, alongside her and Mari. However, Mari had suffered an injury right before their performance, so Kanan and Dia decided to step down and not perform. This failure caused Dia to hide her interest in school idols and initially try and prevent Chika's idol club from happening, but she later joins Chika's group in Episode 9 after Mari and Kanan reconcile.</p>
