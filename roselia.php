            <p><b>Yukina Minato</b></p>
            <p>Age: 16</p>
            <p>Her father, who was a professional singer, is the reason Yukina started singing. One of her goals was to reach the top as a vocalist that would impress her father and encourage him to start his pro career again; as the story goes on, she wants Roselia as a whole to become the best instead of just herself. She is also trying to get Roselia to the "Future World Fes", which is a music festival reserved only for the best bands in the world, and where her father played as well.</p>

            <p><b>Ako Udagawa</b></p>
            <p>Age:15</p>
            <p>Ako is a short, petite girl with big, sharp crimson eyes. She has long light purple hair worn in curled pigtails with matching forelocks and straightened bangs. She is also shown with a fanged tooth frequently in the anime and card art. Her casual attire borders on the mix between punk and gothic design with a cute flair.</p>

            <p><b>Lisa Imai</b></p>
            <p>Age:16</p>
            <p>Lisa is a friendly and lively girl who appears mature and calm. Despite her appearance, Lisa acts as the mediator in tense situations, and takes care of everyone well. It's because of her that Roselia is able to continue to stick together despite the contrasting members personalities and disagreements at times. She often chides the others if she feels necessary, bringing balance to the group. Lisa is very caring in nature, and is able to notice when a friend is troubled, usually being the first to try and help. She does her best to do what she can, sometimes to a fault, where she'll put her all into something regardless of her own feelings. Adding to her caring nature, she sometimes calls herself an "onee-san", but the other characters have also compared her to a mother at times</p>

            <p>Age:16</p>
            <p>Rinko has pale skin, and big, slanted violet eyes. She has long black hair styled loosely after a hime cut; heavy bangs across her forehead with straightened sidelocks that reach past her shoulders. Her casual attire is seen as modest with neutral colors and frilly accents. Rinko wears a white buttoned blouse with ruffles sleeves and a frilly collar tied with a black ribbon. She also wears a black knees length skirt, worn tightened around her waist with gold buttons down the middle and accents.</p>

            <p><b>Sayo Hikawa</b></p>
            <P>Age:18</P>
            <p>Sayo is the older of the twins, but she used to see this as more of a burden than anything. Ever since they were younger, Hina has always bested Sayo in everything, in simple things such as seeing who can swing higher in the playing ground's swings to test scores. Whereas Hina can master new skills with ease, Sayo requires a great deal of information before she can even begin to practice. As a result, Sayo formed a severe inferiority complex towards Hina. One of Sayo's main reasons for starting to play the guitar was because "it was something Hina wasn't doing". Sayo's intense dislike for carrots also comes from her childhood: Hina was actually the one who used to dislike them, and Sayo would always eat Hina's carrots for her, which then resulted in Sayo getting scolded over not eating hers. Despite her dislike, Sayo has said she can't remember what exactly caused her to avoid them.</p>
