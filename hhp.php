            <p><b>Misaki Okusawa</b></p>
            <p>Age:15</p>
            <p>Misaki serves as the "normal girl" trope in the group of five in Hello, Happy World! She is a relatively laidback person who is unable to fight against the flow of a conversation or series of events even if she attempts to do so, the most prominent example being the series of events leading up to her joining the band in the first place. Her initial personality displayed that she didn't want any trouble, never wanted it at any point in time, and would have preferred a quieter life if possible.</p>

            <p><b>Kanon Matsubara</b></p>
            <p>Age:16</p>
            <p>Sensible and responsible, Kanon is one of the members within Hello, Happy World! that manages to keep the band running smoothly, although she is likely to space out and start thinking about jellyfish. She is fairly shy and easily flustered, and can become a nervous wreck at the drop of a hat and start crying if she feels overwhelmed. Whenever she gets nervous or overwhelmed she tends to say "fuee". However, she is also shown to have moments where she is determined and takes matters into her own hands. She is also very caring and kind, as well as hardworking.</p>

            <p><b>Hagumi Kitazawa</b></p>
            <P>Age:18</P>
            <p>Hagumi is the only daughter of a family of butchers. They own a meat shop, where their bestselling item is their croquette. She often helps and tends around the store during her free time. According to Hagumi, her parents fight often and when this happens, her mother becomes prone to emotional outbursts and her father disappears for days at a time. She also states that her parents don't approve of her energetic personality, as they believe it is not proper for a girl to behave in such a way. As such, she uses sports as an outlet</p>
